What is this project?
Its name is text message extracting framework, which means this script can be used to extract structured messages from a single text file or a set of text files. It relies heavily on Regular Expressions, so there could be a rather steep learning curve, but once you get used to it, I assure you it is quite easy to use. Together with the source code, there's a help document of MS Word format, and it contains several examples. Hopefully, it can give you a comfortable start. Good luck!

Why did I write this tool?
Well, just to get this off my mind, I started to write this because the E language I used in work, which doesn't seem to have a good open-source IDE. So it was really painful to read and search all the E source code. Anyway, the E code has its own grammar and structure, and it's highly extensible, which means the same structure in E can be extended many times over many source files. So in order to collect all the extension of the same structure together, I wrote to script, and another script collect.py (yes, in Python) to wrap up this Ruby script for a clearer and customized interface for E language. Since this underlying tool is very generic, I hope it could be useful for others.
